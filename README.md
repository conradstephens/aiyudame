cd aiyudame
```

2. **Install Dependencies:** Use npm or yarn to install the required dependencies.

```
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

3. **Environment Variables:** Create a `.env.development.local` file in the root directory and add the following environment variables:

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
ELEVENLABS_API_KEY=your_elevenlabs_api_key
ELEVENLABS_VOICE_ID=your_elevenlabs_voice_id
PLANETSCALE_DB_HOST=your_planetscale_hostname

PLANETSCALE_DB_PASSWORD=your_planetscale_password
CRON_SECRET=your_random_generated_secret
# see https://elevenlabs.io/voice-lab about generating a voice id
```

4. **Set Up Planetscale:**

- Go to [planetscale](https://planetscale.com).
- Create an account.
- Create a database.
- Create a branch.
- Create a password for that branch.
- Connect with **Node.js** and copy the `DATABASE_URL` for later
- Switch to connect with **@planetscale/database** copy and paste those values into your `.env.development.local`.

5. **Set Up Prisma:** Create a `.env` file in the prisma folder and paste the `DATABASE_URL` you copied in the previous step like below.
